## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of UK-based and registered non-store online retails transnational data set of transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011


# Online Retail Data Analysis Project

This project involves the analysis of the famous transnational dataset containing all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.

## Overview

The project encompasses the following stages:

1. **Data Exploration, Cleaning, and Preprocessing**: The raw data was imported into R for initial exploration. Data cleaning and preprocessing tasks were performed to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.

2. **Exporting Cleaned Data**: The cleaned and processed data was exported as an Excel file for further analysis and visualization.

3. **Visualization in Power BI**: The Excel data was imported into Power BI for comprehensive visualization. Main data tables were utilized, and additional measures and tables were created to enhance insights.

## Files Included

1. `Online Retail.xlsx`: The original dataset containing transactional information.
2. `cleaned and process.xlsx`: The cleaned and processed dataset ready for analysis.
3. `Data Exploration,cleaning and preprocessing.R`: R scripts for data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing.
4. `PowerBi.pbix`: The Power BI file containing the visualizations and reports.

## Usage

### Data Exploration and Cleaning

The R scripts provided were used for data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing. These scripts can be reviewed for a detailed understanding of the data cleaning process.

### Cleaned Data

The `cleaned and process.xlsx` file contains the cleaned and processed data. This dataset is ready for analysis in any data analysis tool that supports Excel.

### Power BI Visualizations

The `PowerBi.pbix` file can be opened using Power BI Desktop. It contains a set of visualizations and reports derived from the cleaned data. Users can interact with the visualizations to gain insights.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore further:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Review R Scripts**: Examine the R scripts in the `R_scripts` folder for details on data exploration and cleaning.

3. **Explore Cleaned Data**: Open `cleaned and process.xlsx` in your preferred data analysis tool.

4. **View Power BI Visualizations**: Open `PowerBi.pbix` using Power BI Desktop to interact with the visualizations.
